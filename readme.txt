This plugin allows you to easily embed a panorama created using Occipital's 360 Panorama App. 

== Description == 

This plugin allows users to easily embed panoramas created by the 360 Panorama app on iPhone/iPad. Some WordPress users cannot
easily embed Javascript in posts or pages, especially if you switch between HTML and Visual mode in the editor. This shortcode plugin will allow you 
to switch between views without losing your embedded panorama. 

== Usage ==

To use it, call the shortcode in your post or page. 

Example:

[panoembed pano="XXXXX"]

Where XXXXX is the value of the panorama created by the app. If the URL Occipital gives you is http://360.io/sS5Cpw, then the value you'll
need to enter in the shortcode is sS5Cpw. 

You can also specify the width and height of the embed if you need it to fit in a certain area on your post or page. You can do that this way:

[panoembed pano="sS5Cpw" width="600" height="300"]

== Installation ==

1. Upload `pano-embed.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' Menu in WordPress
1. Use the shortcode in  your posts and pages as needed.
